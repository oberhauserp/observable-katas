/**
 * Welcome to the RXJS Kata!  First off, what is a code kata?  Wikipedia explains:
 * 
 *   "Kata is a term used by some programmers in the Software Craftsmanship movement. Computer programmers
 *    who call themselves "Software Craftsmen" will write 'Kata' - small snippets of code that they write
 *    in one sitting, sometimes repeatedly, often daily, in order to build muscle memory and practise 
 *    their craft." 
 * 
 * ...and that's exactly what you'll do here!  
 * 
 * Instructions:  
 * 
 * The class below (RXJSKatas) contains a number of empty methods.  These methods are tested in a test 
 * suite which you can run by running the `npm test` command from the root directory.  Your job is to 
 * complete each method below such that it passes the tests in the testing suite.  NOTE:  You should do 
 * ALL of your work in this file.  Please DO NOT modify the unit tests.

   * exist when the observable is created, but may be "emitted" at a later time.  
   * 
   * We'll start off by creating and returning an observable of our own which emits all the values of an 
   * array (provided in the `theArray` parameter).  The easiest way to do this is using the `of` method

  * This is similar to the higher-order methods on arrays.  Recall that we can apply a map function
  * to an array by invoking the .map() method, e.g.:
  * 
  *   [1,2,3].map(num => num * 2) // returns the array [2,4,6]

  * operator") from the 'rxjs/operators' package (it's already imported for you at the top of this
  * file.)  In order to apply an operator to an observable, you must use the .pipe method on the 
  * observable class.  The general syntax for this is:
